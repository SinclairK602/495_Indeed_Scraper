We aimed to estimate the absolute and age-standardized number of hip fractures 
in Sweden during the past two decades to produce time trends and future 
projections. We used nationwide register data from 1998 to 2019 and a validated 
algorithm to calculate the annual absolute and age-standardized number of 
incident hip fractures over time. The total hip fracture burden was 335,399 
incident events over the 22 years, with a change from 16,180 in 1998 to 13,929 
in 2019, a 14% decrease. One decade after the index hip fracture event, 80% of 
the patients had died, and 11% had a new hip fracture. After considering the 
steady growth of the older population, the decline in the age-standardized 
number of hip fractures from 1998 through 2019 was 29.2% (95% CI 28.1-30.2%) in 
women and 29.3% (95% CI 27.5-30.7%) in men. With a continued similar reduction 
in hip fracture incidence, we can predict that 14,800 hip fractures will occur 
in 2034 and 12,000 in 2050 despite doubling the oldest old (≥ 80 years). Without 
an algorithm, a naïve estimate of the total number of hip fractures over the 
study period was 539,947, with a second 10-year hip fracture risk of 35%. We 
note an ongoing decline in the absolute and age-standardized actual number of 
hip fractures in Sweden, with consequences for future projections.

Carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli (CREC) poses a severe global public health 
risk. This study reveals the worldwide geographic spreading patterns and 
spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of resistance genes in 7918 CREC 
isolates belonging to 497 sequence types (ST) and originating from 75 countries. 
In the last decade, there has been a transition in the prevailing STs from 
highly virulent ST131 and ST38 to higher antibiotic-resistant ST410 and ST167. 
The rise of multi-drug resistant strains of CREC carrying plasmids with 
extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) resistance genes could be attributed to 
three important instances of host-switching events. The spread of CREC was 
associated with the changing trends in blaNDM-5, blaKPC-2, and blaOXA-48, as 
well as the plasmids IncFI, IncFII, and IncI. There were intercontinental 
geographic transfers of major CREC strains. Various crucial transmission hubs 
and patterns have been identified for ST131 in the United Kingdom, Italy, the 
United States, and China, ST167 in India, France, Egypt, and the United States, 
and ST410 in Thailand, Israel, the United Kingdom, France, and the United 
States. This work is valuable in managing CREC infections and preventing CREC 
occurrence and transmission inside healthcare settings and among diverse hosts.

The Catering Service Industry (CSI) experienced profound impacts due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. However, the long-term and multi-timepoint analysis using big 
data remained limited, influencing governmental decision-making. We applied 
Kernel Density Estimation, Shannon Diversity Index, and the Geographic detector 
to explore the spatial heterogeneity and determinants of the CSI in Beijing 
during the pandemic, with monthly granularity. The temporal-spatial dynamics of 
the CSI presented a "W"-shaped trend from 2018 to 2023, with pivotal shifts 
aligning with key pandemic stages. Spatial characteristics exhibited 
heterogeneity, with greater stability in the city center and more pronounced 
shifts in peripheral urban zones. Districts facing intricate outbreaks showed 
lower catering income, and Chinese eateries exhibited heightened resilience 
compared to others. The CSI displayed strong interconnections with living 
service sectors. Development in each district was influenced by economic level, 
population distribution, service facilities convenience, and the risk of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Dominant factors included total retail sales of consumer 
goods, permanent population, average Baidu Heat Index, density of transportation 
and catering service facilities, infection cases and the consecutive days with 
confirmed cases existing. Consequently, we suggested seizing post-pandemic 
recovery as an avenue to unlock the CSI's substantial potential, ushering a 
fresh phase of growth.

BACKGROUND: A recent large multicentre trial found no difference in clinical 
outcomes but identified a possibility of increased mortality rates in patients 
with acute kidney injury (AKI) receiving higher protein. These alarming findings 
highlighted the urgent need to conduct an updated systematic review and 
meta-analysis to inform clinical practice.
METHODS: From personal files, citation searching, and three databases searched 
up to 29-5-2023, we included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adult 
critically ill patients that compared higher vs lower protein delivery with 
similar energy delivery between groups and reported clinical and/or 
patient-centred outcomes. We conducted random-effect meta-analyses and 
subsequently trial sequential analyses (TSA) to control for type-1 and type-2 
errors. The main subgroup analysis investigated studies with and without 
combined early physical rehabilitation intervention. A subgroup analysis of AKI 
vs no/not known AKI was also conducted.
RESULTS: Twenty-three RCTs (n = 3303) with protein delivery of 1.49 ± 0.48 vs 
0.92 ± 0.30 g/kg/d were included. Higher protein delivery was not associated 
with overall mortality (risk ratio [RR]: 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
0.88-1.11; I2 = 0%; 21 studies; low certainty) and other clinical outcomes. In 2 
small studies, higher protein combined with early physical rehabilitation showed 
a trend towards improved self-reported quality-of-life physical function 
measurements at day-90 (standardized mean difference 0.40, 95% CI - 0.04 to 
0.84; I2 = 30%). In the AKI subgroup, higher protein delivery significantly 
increased mortality (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.11-1.82; I2 = 0%; 3 studies; confirmed by 
TSA with high certainty, and the number needed to harm is 7). Higher protein 
delivery also significantly increased serum urea (mean difference 2.31 mmol/L, 
95% CI 1.64-2.97; I2 = 0%; 7 studies).
CONCLUSION: Higher, compared with lower protein delivery, does not appear to 
affect clinical outcomes in general critically ill patients but may increase 
mortality rates in patients with AKI. Further investigation of the combined 
early physical rehabilitation intervention in non-AKI patients is warranted.

BACKGROUND: The current guidelines have discouraged the routine use of 
intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) in cardiogenic shock complicating acute 
coronary syndrome (ACS). Since then, the trend of IABP utilization in ACS has 
been declining. Nevertheless, the guidelines still preserve the recommendation 
of IABP use in hemodynamic instability or cardiogenic shock caused by post 
myocardial infarction (MI) ventricular septal rupture (VSR).
CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-years-old diabetic Southeast Asian female was referred 
from a peripheral facility with intractable heart failure despite treatment with 
vasoactive agents and diuretics for five days. The ECG suggested a recent 
anteroseptal myocardial infarction with normal high-sensitivity troponin-I 
value. The echocardiography detected a regional wall motion abnormality and a 
10 mm wide ventricular septal defect. Invasive coronary angiography revealed a 
severe two-vessel coronary artery disease. We planned a delayed surgical 
strategy with preoperative optimization using IABP as a bridge to surgery. IABP 
implantation followed by significant hemodynamic improvement and rapid 
resolution of heart failure without any inotrope support. Afterwards, coronary 
artery bypass grafting (CABG) and VSR surgical repair were performed. We safely 
removed IABP on the third postoperative day with proper weaning and minimal 
vasoactive support.
CONCLUSION: We report a case where IABP still provided benefits for a patient 
with intractable heart failure caused by undetermined onset MI complicated by 
VSR. The use of IABP in such a case is in accordance with the recommendation of 
the current guidelines. Several studies showed that IABP use during preoperative 
optimization in the case of post-MI VSR was associated with survival benefits.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of 
different residual meniscus volume on the biomechanics of tibiofemoral joint 
after discoid lateral meniscus (DLM) surgery by finite element analysis.
METHODS: A knee joint model was established based on CT and MRI imaging data. 
The DLM model was divided into five regions according to conventional 
meniscectomy, with volumes of 15%, 15%, 15%, 15%, 15%, and 40% for each region. 
Additionally, the DLM model was divided into anterior and posterior parts to 
obtain ten regions. The DLM was resected according to the design scheme, and 
together with the intact discoid meniscus, a total of 15 models were obtained. 
Finite element analysis was conducted to assess shear and pressure trends on the 
knee joint.
RESULTS: The study observed significant changes in peak shear stress and 
compressive stress in the lateral meniscus and lateral femur cartilage. As the 
meniscus volume decreased, there was an increase in these stresses. 
Specifically, when the meniscus volume reduced to 40%, there was a sharp 
increase in shear stress (302%) and compressive stress (152%) on the meniscus, 
as well as shear stress (195%) and compressive stress (157%) on the lateral 
femur cartilage. Furthermore, the model grouping results showed that preserving 
a higher frontal volume in the meniscus model provided better biomechanical 
advantages.
CONCLUSION: The use of finite element analysis has demonstrated that preserving 
more than 55% of the meniscus volume is necessary to prevent a significant 
increase in joint stress, which can potentially lead to joint degeneration. 
Additionally, it is crucial to preserve the front volume of the DLM in order to 
achieve improved knee biomechanical outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Microvascular pathology is one of the main characteristics of 
diabetic cardiomyopathy; however, the early longitudinal course of diabetic 
microvascular dysfunction remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the 
early dynamic changes in left ventricular (LV) microvascular function in 
diabetic pig model using the cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-derived 
quantitative perfusion technique.
METHODS: Twelve pigs with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) were 
included in this study, and longitudinal CMR scanning was performed before and 
2, 6, 10, and 16 months after diabetic modeling. CMR-derived semiquantitative 
parameters (upslope, maximal signal intensity, perfusion index, and myocardial 
perfusion reserve index [MPRI]) and fully quantitative perfusion parameters 
(myocardial blood flow [MBF] and myocardial perfusion reserve [MPR]) were 
analyzed to evaluate longitudinal changes in LV myocardial microvascular 
function. Pearson correlation was used to analyze the relationship between LV 
structure and function and myocardial perfusion function.
RESULTS: With the progression of DM duration, the upslope at rest showed a 
gradually increasing trend (P = 0.029); however, the upslope at stress and MBF 
did not change significantly (P > 0.05). Regarding perfusion reserve function, 
both MPRI and MPR showed a decreasing trend with the progression of disease 
duration (MPRI, P = 0.001; MPR, P = 0.042), with high consistency (r = 0.551, 
P < 0.001). Furthermore, LV MPR is moderately associated with LV longitudinal 
strain (r = - 0.353, P = 0.022), LV remodeling index (r = - 0.312, P = 0.033), 
fasting blood glucose (r = - 0.313, P = 0.043), and HbA1c (r = - 0.309, 
P = 0.046). Microscopically, pathological results showed that collagen volume 
fraction increased gradually, whereas no significant decrease in microvascular 
density was observed with the progression of DM duration.
CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial microvascular reserve function decreased gradually in 
the early stage of DM, which is related to both structural (but not reduced 
microvascular density) and functional abnormalities of microvessels, and is 
associated with increased blood glucose, reduced LV deformation, and myocardial 
remodeling.

BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been widely and 
increasingly used worldwide during the past decades. Nevertheless, studies in 
long-term trends of CAM use are limited. The aim of this study was to assess 
long-term trends in the prevalence of CAM use (both overall and for specific 
CAMs) between 1987 and 2021 in the adult Danish population and to examine 
certain sociodemographic characteristics of CAM users.
METHODS: Data derived from nationally representative health surveys in the 
general adult population (≥ 16 years) in Denmark (the Danish Health and 
Morbidity Surveys) conducted in 1987, 1994, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2013, 2017, and 
2021. The response proportion declined from 79.9% in 1987 to 45.4% in 2021. CAM 
use was assessed by questions on ever use of specific types of CAMs and overall 
use within the past 12 months. Differences in use of CAMs across educational 
levels were assessed using the Slope Index of Inequality (SII).
RESULTS: An overall increase in the prevalence of CAM use within the past 12 
months was found between 1987 (10.0%) and 2021 (24.0%). However, a stagnation 
was observed between 2010 and 2017, after which the prevalence decreased in 
2021. In all survey waves, the prevalence was higher among women than men. For 
both sexes, the prevalence tended to be highest among respondents aged 25-44 
years and 45-64 years. The group with 13-14 years of education had the highest 
prevalence of CAM use compared to the other educational groups (< 10 years, 
10-12 years, and ≥ 15 years). SII values for both men and women increased 
between 1987 and 2021, which indicates an increase in differences of CAM use 
across educational groups. In all survey waves the most frequently used CAMs 
included massage and other manipulative therapies, acupuncture, and reflexology.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of CAM has increased markedly within the last decades and 
recently stagnated at high levels, which underlines the importance of securing 
high quality information and education for the public, health professionals, and 
legislators to ensure and promote safe use of CAMs.

BACKGROUND: In Sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence of dyslipidemia is on the 
rise, with studies showing dyslipidemia as a contributing factor to the 
progression of premalignant lesions to cervical cancer. In Uganda, cervical 
cancer and dyslipidemia are common health concerns, considering the increasing 
trends of dyslipidemia in the general population and inadequate information 
regarding dyslipidemia and cervical lesions. This study aimed to determine the 
prevalence of dyslipidemia and its association with precancerous and cancerous 
lesions of the cervix among women attending a cervical cancer clinic at the 
Uganda Cancer Institute.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from February to April 2022 
among women with premalignant and malignant lesions of the cervix. Data on 
social demographics and health-seeking behaviours were collected using a 
pretested structured questionnaire after written informed consent had been 
obtained. Pap smear collection preceded visual inspection with acetic acid; 
cervical biopsies were collected appropriately from eligible participants; and 
cervical lesions were classified using the Bethesda system 2014. Serum lipids, 
total cholesterol (T.C.), high-density lipoprotein (HDLc), low-density 
lipoprotein (LDLc), and triglycerides (T.G.s) were analysed using the COBAS™ 
6000 Clinical Chemistry Analyser. The associations were assessed using the 
chi-square test, and P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of dyslipidemia among women with cervical 
lesions was 118/159 (74%), and low HDLc was the most prevalent at 64.6% (95% CI 
39.0-54.3). High T.C. (P = 0.05), high T.G.s (P = 0.011), and low HDL-c 
(P = 0.05) showed a significant association with precancerous lesions. High 
LDL-c (P = 0.019), high T.G.s (P = 0.02), and high T.G.s (P < 0.001) showed a 
statistically significant association with cancerous lesions.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of dyslipidemia was high, with high TC, T.G.s, and 
low HDL-c significantly associated with precancerous lesions. Also, elevated 
T.G.s and high LDLc were significantly associated with cancerous lesions. Women 
may benefit from dyslipidemia screening along with cervical cancer screening.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: The present study builds upon previous findings suggesting 
a link between dyslipidemia and cervical lesions by investigating the 
relationship between these two factors, specifically in women of this 
geographical location, where we need adequate information on these associations.

BACKGROUND: Psychoactive drug combinations are increasingly contributing to 
overdose deaths among White and Black Americans. To understand the evolving 
nature of overdose crisis, inform policies, and develop tailored and equitable 
interventions, this study provides a comprehensive assessment of polysubstance 
mortality trends by race and sex during the opioid epidemic.
METHODS: We used serial cross-sectional US mortality data for White and Black 
populations from 1999 through 2018 to calculate annual age-adjusted death rates 
(AADR) involving any opioid, opioid subtypes, benzodiazepines, cocaine, 
psychostimulants, or combinations of these drugs, stratified by race and sex. 
Trend changes in AADR were analyzed using joinpoint regression models and 
expressed as average annual percent change (AAPC) during each period of the 
three waves of the opioid epidemic: 1999-2010 (wave 1), 2010-2013 (wave 2), and 
2013-2018 (wave 3). Prevalence measures assessed the percent co-involvement of 
an investigated drug in the overall death from another drug.
RESULTS: Polysubstance mortality has shifted from a modest rise in death rates 
due to benzodiazepine-opioid overdoses among White persons (wave 1) to a 
substantial increase in death rates due to illicit drug combinations impacting 
both White and Black populations (wave 3). Concurrent cocaine-opioid use had the 
highest polysubstance mortality rates in 2018 among Black (5.28 per 100,000) and 
White (3.53 per 100,000) persons. The steepest increase in death rates during 
wave 3 was observed across all psychoactive drugs when combined with synthetic 
opioids in both racial groups. Since 2013, Black persons have died faster from 
cocaine-opioid and psychostimulant-opioid overdoses. Between 2013 and 2018, 
opioids were highly prevalent in cocaine-related deaths, increasing by 33% in 
White persons compared to 135% in Blacks. By 2018, opioids contributed to 
approximately half of psychostimulant and 85% of benzodiazepine fatal overdoses 
in both groups. The magnitude and type of drug combinations with the highest 
death rates differed by race and sex, with Black men exhibiting the highest 
overdose burden beginning in 2013.
CONCLUSIONS: The current drug crisis should be considered in the context of 
polysubstance use. Effective measures and policies are needed to curb synthetic 
opioid-involved deaths and address disparate mortality rates in Black 
communities.

OBJECTIVE: Tobacco has been identified as a significant contributory element to 
the development of breast cancer. Our objective was to evaluate the 
spatiotemporal trends of tobacco-related breast cancer at the global, regional, 
and national scales during 1990-2019.
METHODS: We extracted data on mortality, disability adjusted of life years 
(DALYs), age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), and age-standardized DALYs rate 
(ASDR) from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2019. Estimated annual 
percentage change (EAPC) was computed to assess the temporal change in ASDR and 
ASMR.
RESULTS: In 2019, the deaths and DALYs attributed to tobacco-related breast 
cancer were estimated to be 35,439 (95% UI: 22,179-48,119) and 1,060,590 (95% 
UI: 622,550-1,462,580), respectively. These figures accounted for 5.1% and 5.2% 
of the total burden of breast cancer. ASMR and ASDR increased in low SDI 
regions, remained stable in low-middle and middle SDI regions and declined in 
high and high-middle SDI regions. The burden of breast cancer attributable to 
tobacco varied notably among regions and nations. Oceania, Southern Latin 
America, and Central Europe were the GBD regions with the highest number of ASMR 
and DALYs. There was a positive relationship between age-standardized rate and 
SDI value in 2019 across 204 nations or territories. A negative association was 
observed between the EAPC in ASMR or ASDR and the human development index (HDI) 
in 2019 (R = -0.55, p < 0.01 for ASMR; R = -0.56, p < 0.01 for ASDR).
CONCLUSION: Tobacco is one important and modifiable risk factor for breast 
cancer. The heterogeneity in both the spatial and temporal distribution can be 
attributed to factors such as aging, population growth, and SDI. These findings 
substantiate the necessity of expediting the enforcement of tobacco-free 
legislation in order to safeguard populations from the detrimental effects of 
tobacco.

BACKGROUND: Due to the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic in 2020, the interest of nutritional supplements has emerged. Limited 
data are available on how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the search interest in 
nutritional supplements in Taiwan and worldwide. The study aims to investigate 
changes in public search interest of nutritional supplements pre- and during the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Our World in Data dataset was used to collect both global and local 
(Taiwan) number of COVID-19 newly confirmed cases and deaths. Google Trends 
search query was being used to obtain relative search volumes (RSVs) covering a 
timeframe between 2019 to 2022. Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficients 
were used to measure relationships between confirmed new cases and deaths and 
RSVs of nutritional supplements. Multivariate analysis was conducted to examine 
the effect of domestic and global new cases and deaths on the RSVs of 
nutritional supplements.
RESULTS: The mean RSVs for nutritional supplements were higher during the 
COVID-19 pandemic period (between 2020 to 2022) compared to the pre-pandemic 
period (year of 2019) for both Taiwan and worldwide. In terms of seasonal 
variations, except for vitamin D, the mean RSVs of probiotics, vitamin B 
complex, and vitamin C in winter were significantly lower compared to other 
seasons in Taiwan. The RSVs of nutritional supplements were not only affected by 
domestic cases and deaths but also by global new cases and deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: The interests in nutritional supplements had substantially 
increased in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The RSVs of nutritional 
supplements in Taiwan were not only influenced by global and domestic pandemic 
severity but also by seasons.

BACKGROUND: "Core values" help to guide practice of health care delivery. The 
core values of general practice are described in the European definition of 
general practice by WONCA, e.g. a holistic, comprehensive and continuous care. 
They may be associated with the idea that the general practitioner is the owner 
of the practice rather than an employee.
OBJECTIVES: The objective was to examine the core values of employed GPs in 
their professional setting and their practical manifestation.
METHODS: From April to May 2021, we conducted 17 semi-structured 
telephone-interviews with employed GPs in two districts in Baden-Wuerttemberg, 
Germany. The data were analysed using qualitative content analysis.
RESULTS: We identified twelve core values, including values relevant to patient 
care and values relevant to the lives of employed GPs. Values with high 
relevance were job satisfaction, the professional distance from patients, 
collaboration and collegial exchange, comprehensive care, adequate consultation 
time and availability to patients. Values with heterogeneous relevance were 
continuity of care, waiting times and medical autonomy. The value "availability" 
of employed GPs to patients was associated with both patient care and personal 
life. The limited availability of employed GPs was accompanied by tensions 
between these two trends and other values.
CONCLUSION: The values of employed GPs are partly consistent with the current 
WONCA definition of general practice. There were also indications of new values. 
The increase in the proportion of employed GPs implies a need to reflect on the 
core values of general practice, taking into account factors on the part of 
employed GPs, patients, and practice organisation.

Research retreats are elements of scientific graduate training programs. 
Although expected to provide strong educational value, some students are 
reluctant to attend. Here, we identify participation barriers and provide 
guidelines for retreat design that minimize obstacles and establish an inclusive 
environment to improve attendance and enrichment for all attendees.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading 
causes of death worldwide, which is partly contributed to the increasing 
prevalence of COPD owning to a demographic shift towards an older population. 
Conversely, recent studies on COPD mortality that take this demographic shift in 
age into account find decreasing overall age-standardised COPD mortality rates 
over time. This decrease in the age-standardised COPD mortality rate is 
contributed advances in COPD diagnostics and treatment, decreasing smoking 
prevalence and general advances in medical care particularly in western 
countries. However, it is unknown if patients with COPD have experienced a 
comparable relative increase in survival in line with the general 
population.Hence, there is a need for longitudinal studies comparing trends in 
mortality in patients with COPD compared with matched non-COPD individuals from 
the background population.
METHODS AND ANALYSES: This is a cohort study with a matched non-COPD comparator 
cohort. Data are retrieved from the Danish national registers. Data from 
multiple registries from 1983 to 2018 will be merged on an individual level 
using the 10-digit Civil Registration numbers that are unique to each citizen in 
Denmark. Time trends in mortality in patients with COPD compared with the 
matched comparator cohort will be examined in three study periods: 1983-1993, 
1994-2007 and 2008-2018.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is entirely based on registry data and 
ethical approval is not required according to Danish Law and National Ethics 
Committee Guidelines. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals 
and reported at appropriate national and international conferences.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of burden 
estimates and the secular trend of vision loss due to retinopathy of prematurity 
(ROP) among people younger than 20 years, at the global, regional and national 
levels.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 
database. The average annual percentage change (AAPC) was calculated to quantify 
the temporal trends in the measures of vision loss.
RESULTS: In 2019, the global age-standardised rates (ASRs) of prevalence per 
100 000 population was 86.4 for vision loss, specifically, 35 for moderate 
vision loss, 19.9 for severe vision loss, 31.6 for blindness due to ROP among 
people younger than 20 years. Moreover, the ASR of years lived with disability 
per 100 000 was 10.6 for vision loss, specifically, 1.1 for moderate vision 
loss, 3.6 for severe vision loss, 5.9 for blindness, respectively. From 1990 to 
2019, the ASR of prevalence of blindness and vision loss due to ROP 
significantly increased, while its burden slightly decreased. Males showed 
higher ASR of prevalence than females in 2019, whereas females have larger 
increasing trend than males from 1990 to 2019. The global highest ASR of disease 
burden was observed in South Asia and Southern sub-Saharan Africa, as well as 
low sociodemographic index (SDI) regions in 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: Globally, although the burden decreased, the prevalence of 
childhood and adulthood vision loss due to ROP continues to increase. Reasonable 
resource allocation and advanced intervention are recommended to prevent and 
control the vision loss due to ROP.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the incidence of suicidal ideation and its 
associated risk factors in the São Paulo state of ELSA-Brasil cohort during the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: During a pre-pandemic ELSA-Brasil onsite assessment in 2016-2018 (wave 
3) and a pandemic online assessment in May-July 2020 (wave COVID), we assessed 
suicidal ideation using the Clinical Interview Scheduled-Revised (CIS-R). Single 
and multi predictor logistic regressions were performed using sociodemographic 
characteristics, household finance impact during pandemic, presence of previous 
chronic diseases, alcohol abuse, adverse childhood experiences (ACE), living 
alone, and previous CMD as predictors. Suicidal ideation incidence was used as 
outcome.
RESULTS: Out of 4191 participants of wave 3, 2117 (50.5%) answered wave COVID. 
There was a threefold increase in suicide ideation, from 34 (1.8%) to 104 
(5.6%).In multiple predictor models, we found that previous CMD (OR 7.17; 95% CI 
4.43 - 11.58) and ACE (OR 1.72; 95% CI 1.09 - 2.72) increased the odds of 
incident suicidal ideation. The sociodemographic predictors female sex, younger 
age and low income were significant risk factors only in the single predictor 
model. Conclusions These findings underscore the importance of monitoring and 
supporting individuals who suffered ACE and have a history of mental health 
disorders. This is especially critical in times of heightened societal stress, 
such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the importance of monitoring and 
supporting individuals who suffered ACE and have a history of mental health 
disorders. This is especially critical in times of heightened societal stress, 
such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Food allergy (FA) has been reported in one-third of children with 
moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD).
OBJECTIVE: To identify factor associated with food allergy among preschool 
children with AD, and to compare AD resolution between preschool children with 
and without FA.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study using database registry and questionnaire 
interview was conducted at Siriraj Hospital(Bangkok, Thailand) during 2022, and 
physician-diagnosed AD children aged ≤ 6 years were enrolled.
RESULTS: A total of 110 children (60.9% male, median age: 2.3 years) were 
included. Of those, 53 and 57 children had AD with and without FA, respectively. 
Very early-onset AD (≤ 3 months) and moderate-to-severe AD at onset were 
reported in 43.9% and 26.3% of AD without FA, and in 35.8% and 45.3% of AD with 
FA, respectively. The most commonly reported FAs were hen's egg, cow's milk, and 
wheat. Moderate-to-severe AD at onset was found significant associated with FA 
(aOR: 2.50; p = 0.037). Thirty-one (28.2%) patients experienced completed 
resolution of AD by 5 years of age. Of those, 19 had AD without FA, and 12 had 
AD with FA (p = 0.213). The median age at AD resolution was 18 months and 22.5 
months in the without and with FA groups, respectively. AD with FA showed a 
strong trend toward a significantly longer duration to achieving AD resolution 
after adjusting for onset and severity of AD (aHR: 0.46, p = 0.050).
CONCLUSION: Preschool AD children with FA were found to have significantly 
greater AD severity at AD onset and a longer duration to AD resolution compared 
to AD children without FA.

Immunosenescence is the age-related changes in the immune system, namely, 
progressively higher levels of circulating inflammatory markers, characteristics 
changes of circulating immune subset cells and altered immune function. The 
neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NL ratio) has been identified as a prognostic 
indicator for neoplastic disease progression, in predicting chronic degenerative 
diseases, and as a potential indirect marker of healthy aging. This study aims 
to examine the longitudinal association of neutrophil, lymphocyte absolute 
count, and their ratio with longitudinal risk for multimorbidity and mortality. 
The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) is an open observational cohort 
study of community-dwelling volunteers that are followed every 1-4 years 
depending on their age. The sample considered in the study consists of 1769 
participants (5090 follow-ups) with completed data for physical examination, 
health history assessment, and donated a blood sample. The NL ratio increased 
with age and was associated with a higher risk of mortality, while a lower NL 
ratio was inversely correlated with multimorbidity. Neutrophils increased with 
aging and an increase in their absolute number predicted mortality risk. 
However, the absolute number of lymphocytes was associated with age only in a 
cross-sectional analysis. In conclusion, this study supports the importance of 
the NL ratio and absolute neutrophil count as markers of aging health status, 
and as significant predictors of all-cause mortality and multimorbidity in aging 
individuals. It remains to be demonstrated whether interventions contrasting 
these trends in circulating cells may result in improved health outcomes.

In the context of escalating obesity rates, bariatric surgery holds a crucial 
role in managing severely obese patients. With a demonstrated effectiveness in 
weight loss and with the advent of ambulatory surgery, bariatric surgery allows 
for a streamlined care pathway, ideally suited for postoperative surveillance 
using digital health applications. The aim of this systematic review and 
meta-analysis is to evaluate the effect of eHealth-delivered health services or 
support for adults undergoing bariatric surgery. Five studies, encompassing 2210 
patients, were analysed. The intervention group showed a 10% increase in total 
weight reduction and a 22% reduction in excess weight loss. ED visitation rates 
also trended towards reduction. Despite the absence of clear statistical 
superiority for DHA, the findings suggest potential benefits of DHA in 
postoperative monitoring.

Dysfunctional sensory systems, including altered olfactory function, have 
recently been reported in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). 
Disturbances in olfactory processing can potentially result from 
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic synaptic abnormalities. The specific 
molecular mechanism by which GABAergic transmission affects the olfactory system 
in ASD remains unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate selected 
components of the GABAergic system in olfactory brain regions and primary 
olfactory neurons isolated from Shank3-deficient (-/-) mice, which are known for 
their autism-like behavioral phenotype. Shank3 deficiency led to a significant 
reduction in GEPHYRIN/GABAAR colocalization in the piriform cortex and in 
primary neurons isolated from the olfactory bulb, while no change of cell 
morphology was observed. Gene expression analysis revealed a significant 
reduction in the mRNA levels of GABA transporter 1 in the olfactory bulb and 
Collybistin in the frontal cortex of the Shank3-/- mice compared to WT mice. A 
similar trend of reduction was observed in the expression of Somatostatin in the 
frontal cortex of Shank3-/- mice. The analysis of the expression of other 
GABAergic neurotransmission markers did not yield statistically significant 
results. Overall, it appears that Shank3 deficiency leads to changes in 
GABAergic synapses in the brain regions that are important for olfactory 
information processing, which may represent basis for understanding functional 
impairments in autism.

Species-specific anatomical and morphological characteristics of Pinus 
sylvestris and Larix sibirica needles were studied at different levels of tree 
stand pollution by aluminum smelter emissions. The anatomical characteristics of 
the needle were studied using light microscopy. The level of tree stand 
pollution was determined using the cluster analysis outcomes of the pollutant 
elements content (fluorine, sulfur, and heavy metals) in the needles. Four 
levels of tree stand pollution were separated: low, moderate, high, and 
critical, as well as background tree stand in unpolluted areas. It was found 
that the state of tree phytomass deteriorated with increasing levels of 
pollution (from low to critical): pine crown defoliation increased to 85%, and 
larch defoliation increased to 65%. The life span of pine needles was reduced to 
2-3 years, with a background value of 6-7 years. The change of morphological 
parameters was more pronounced in P. sylvestris: the weight and length of the 
2-year-old shoot decreased by 2.7-3.1 times compared to the background values; 
the weight of needles on the shoot and the number of needle pairs on the 
shoot-by 1.9-2.1 times. The length of the needle and shoot and the number of L. 
sibirica brachyblasts decreased by 1.8-1.9 times. The anatomical parameters of 
the needle also changed to a greater extent in P. sylvestris. Up to the high 
level of tree pollution, we observed a decrease in the cross-sectional area of 
the needle, central cylinder, vascular bundle, area and thickness of mesophyll, 
number and diameter of resin ducts by 18-66% compared to background values. At 
the critical pollution level, when the content of pollutant elements in pine 
needles reached maximum values, the anatomical parameters of the remaining few 
green needles were close to background values. In our opinion, this may be due 
to the activation of mechanisms aimed at maintaining the viability of trees. A 
reduction in thickness and area of assimilation tissue in the L. sibirica needle 
was detected only at the critical pollution level. An upward trend in these 
parameters was found at low, medium, and high pollution levels of tree stand, 
which may indicate an adaptive nature. The results suggested that at a similar 
pollution level of trees, the greatest amount of negative anatomical and 
morphological changes were recorded in pine needles, which indicates a greater 
sensitivity of this species to technogenic emissions.

PURPOSE: Remnant cholesterol (RC) is a contributor to cardiovascular diseases, 
obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. However, the specific relationship 
between RC and bone metabolism remains unexplored. Therefore, we aimed to 
investigate the relationships of RC with hip bone mineral density (BMD) and the 
risk of low bone mass.
METHODS: Physical examination data was collected from men aged < 60 years as 
part of the Kailuan Study between 2014 and 2018. The characteristics of the 
participants were compared between RC quartile groups. A generalized linear 
regression model was used to evaluate the relationship between RC and hip BMD 
and a logistic regression model was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for low bone mass. Additional analyses were performed 
after stratification by body mass index (BMI) (≥ or < 24 kg/m2). Sensitivity 
analyses were performed by excluding individuals who were taking lipid-lowering 
therapy or had cancer, cardiovascular diseases, or diabetes.
RESULTS: Data from a total of 7,053 participants were included in the analysis. 
After adjustment for confounding factors, RC negatively correlated with hip BMD 
(β =  - 0.0079, 95% CI: - 0.0133, - 0.0025). The risk of low bone mass increased 
from the lowest to the highest RC quartile, with ORs of 1 (reference), 1.09 (95% 
CI: (0.82, 1.44), 1.35 (95%CI: 1.02, 1.77), and 1.43 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.89) for 
Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively (P for trend = 0.004) in the fully adjusted 
model. Compared to RC < 0.80 mmol/l group, the risk of low bone mass increased 
39% in RC ≥ 0.80 mmol/l group (P < 0.001). The correlation between RC and hip 
BMD was stronger in participants with BMI ≥ 24 kg/m2 group (β =  - 0.0159, 95% 
CI: - 0.0289, - 0.0029). The results of sensitivity analyses were consistent 
with the main results.
CONCLUSION: We have identified a negative correlation between serum RC and hip 
BMD, and a higher RC concentration was found to be associated with a greater 
risk of low bone mass in young and middle-aged men.

Evidence-based practice (EBP) fidelity, understood as the extent to which a 
program is implemented as the developers intended, is a key implementation 
variable which likely relates to consumer outcomes. However, studies that track 
fidelity longitudinally and at large scale are uncommon, and finding reliable 
predictors of fidelity has proven to be a complex challenge. Further, attitudes 
toward EBP are a potentially important predictor of fidelity, but results across 
the literature have been mixed. The purpose of the present study is to use data 
from the ongoing implementation and dissemination of the SafeCare model to 
better understand (1) the characteristics of SafeCare implementation fidelity 
trajectories, and (2) whether individual level factors predict differences in 
fidelity and fidelity trajectories, especially provider attitudes toward EBP. 
The analyses reported here include 14,778 observed fidelity sessions by 868 
providers in 172 agencies. We use multilevel modeling to examine fidelity, 
fidelity trajectories over time, and several potential individual-level 
predictors of fidelity, including demographics, work history, and attitudes 
toward EBP. We found: (1) that SafeCare fidelity begins high at baseline (93.85% 
on average); (2) that SafeCare fidelity displays a statistically significant 
trend of positive linear growth, even among those with less positive attitudes; 
and (3) that positive attitudes are associated with slightly higher fidelity on 
average and at baseline, while negative attitudes are associated with slightly 
lower fidelity on average and at baseline. To our knowledge, this is the largest 
longitudinal analysis of EBP fidelity in a child welfare program to date, and 
our findings support the notion that intensive coaching supports which are 
titrated over time can be sufficient to ensure sustained high fidelity, at least 
in some cases. Further, these findings indicate that robust training and 
coaching processes can ensure high fidelity and fidelity growth even among 
providers with less positive attitudes toward EBP.

Significant changes in rainfall patterns are critical to agriculture, and the 
dependency of cropping systems on rainfall variability would engender 
appropriate farming practices and agriculture policies for a climate-resilient 
agriculture system. This study analyses the significance of rainfall variability 
on agriculture productivity in the Wayanad district of Kerala (India) using time 
series data on rainfall (1989-2019) and crop yield (2000-2019). The spatial 
variability of rainfall patterns reveals a dichotomy between the rain gauge 
stations in the northern and southern parts of the region. Despite the absence 
of statistically significant trends in the monthly, seasonal and annual 
rainfall, based on the Mann-Kendall trend analysis, an increase in the yield of 
many crops (e.g., winter paddy, banana) is evident, which emphasises the 
critical role of irrigation in driving the crop productivity. As an adaptation 
strategy to changing rainfall patterns, irrigation would meet the additional 
crop water requirement for sustainable agricultural production under the varying 
rainfall distributions. However, the increase in the area under irrigation in 
recent years has had significant implications for both surface water and 
groundwater resources. The conclusive findings suggest that the region requires 
climate-resilient agriculture, focusing on optimising irrigation and developing 
sustainable agriculture and water conservation strategies.

PURPOSE: The potential of targeting forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) as a therapeutic 
approach for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is promising. However, a 
comprehensive understanding of FOXC1 regulation, particularly upstream factors, 
remains elusive. Expression of the L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM), a 
transmembrane glycoprotein associated with brain metastasis, was observed to be 
positively associated with FOXC1 transcripts. Thus, this study aims to 
investigate their relationship in TNBC progression.
METHODS: Publicly available FOXC1 and L1CAM transcriptomic data were obtained, 
and their corresponding proteins were analyzed in four TNBC cell lines. In BT549 
cells, FOXC1 and L1CAM were individually silenced, while L1CAM was overexpressed 
in BT549-shFOXC1, MDA-MB-231, and HCC1937 cells. CCK-8, transwell, and wound 
healing assays were performed in these cell lines, and immunohistochemical 
staining was conducted in tumor samples.
RESULTS: A positive correlation between L1CAM and FOXC1 transcripts was observed 
in publicly available datasets. In BT549 cells, knockdown of FOXC1 led to 
reduced L1CAM expression at both the transcriptional and protein levels, and 
conversely, silencing of L1CAM decreased FOXC1 protein levels, but 
interestingly, FOXC1 transcripts remained largely unaffected. Overexpressing 
L1CAM resulted in increased FOXC1 protein expression without significant changes 
in FOXC1 mRNA levels. This trend was also observed in BT549-shFOXC1, 
MDA-MB-231-L1CAM, and HCC1937-L1CAM cells. Notably, alterations in FOXC1 or 
L1CAM levels corresponded to changes in cell proliferation, migration, and 
invasion capacities. Furthermore, a positive correlation between L1CAM and FOXC1 
protein expression was detected in human TNBC tumors.
CONCLUSION: FOXC1 and L1CAM exhibit co-regulation at the protein level, with 
FOXC1 regulating at the transcriptional level and L1CAM regulating at the 
post-transcriptional level, and together they positively influence cell 
proliferation, migration, and invasion in TNBC.

This study aims to describe the patterns and trends in antipsychotic 
prescription among Dutch youth before and during the corona virus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic (between 2017 and 2022). The study specifically aims to 
determine whether there has been an increase or decrease in antipsychotic 
prescription among this population, and whether there are any differences in 
prescription patterns among different age and sex groups. The study utilized the 
IADB database, which is a pharmacy prescription database containing dispensing 
data from approximately 120 community pharmacies in the Netherlands, to analyze 
the monthly prevalence and incidence rates of antipsychotic prescription among 
Dutch youth before and during the pandemic. The study also examined the 
prescribing patterns of the five most commonly used antipsychotics and conducted 
an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) analysis using data prior to 
the pandemic, to predict the expected prevalence rate during the pandemic. The 
prescription rate of antipsychotics for Dutch youth was slightly affected by the 
pandemic, with a monthly prevalence of 4.56 [4.50-4.62] per 1000 youths before 
COVID-19 pandemic and 4.64 [4.59-4.69] during the pandemic. A significant 
increase in prevalence was observed among adolescent girls aged 13-19 years. The 
monthly incidence rate remained stable overall, but rose for adolescent girls 
aged 13-19 years. Aripiprazole, and Quetiapine had higher monthly prevalence 
rates during the pandemic, while Risperidone and Pipamperon had lower rates. 
Similarly, the monthly incidence rates of Aripiprazole and Olanzapine went up, 
while Risperidone went down. Furthermore, the results from the ARIMA analysis 
revealed that despite the pandemic, the monthly prevalence rate of antipsychotic 
prescription was within expectation. The findings of this study suggest that 
there has been a moderate increase in antipsychotic prescription among Dutch 
youth during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in adolescent females aged 
13-19 years. However, the study also suggests that factors beyond the pandemic 
may be contributing to the rise in antipsychotic prescription in Dutch youth.

PURPOSE: Surgical approach to rectal cancer has evolved in recent decades, with 
introduction of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) techniques and local excision. 
Since implementation might differ internationally, this study is aimed at 
evaluating trends in surgical approach to rectal cancer across different 
countries over the last 10 years and to gain insight into patient, tumour and 
treatment characteristics.
METHODS: Pseudo-anonymised data of patients undergoing resection for rectal 
cancer between 2010 and 2019 were extracted from clinical audits in the 
Netherlands (NL), Sweden (SE), England-Wales (EW) and Australia-New Zealand 
(AZ).
RESULTS: Ninety-nine thousand five hundred ninety-seven patients were included 
(38,413 open, 55,155 MIS and 5416 local excision). An overall increase in MIS 
was observed from 29.9% in 2010 to 72.1% in 2019, with decreasing conversion 
rates (17.5-9.0%). The MIS proportion was highly variable between countries in 
the period 2010-2014 (54.4% NL, 45.3% EW, 39.8% AZ, 14.1% SE, P < 0.001), but 
variation reduced over time (2015-2019 78.8% NL, 66.3% EW, 64.3% AZ, 53.2% SE, 
P < 0.001). The proportion of local excision for the two periods was highly 
variable between countries: 4.7% and 11.8% in NL, 3.9% and 7.4% in EW, 4.7% and 
4.6% in AZ, 6.0% and 2.9% in SE.
CONCLUSIONS: Application and speed of implementation of MIS were highly variable 
between countries, but each registry demonstrated a significant increase over 
time. Local excision revealed inconsistent trends over time.

This study aimed to investigate differences in pediatric healthcare utilization 
in Israel over 10 years by examining differences across populations defined by 
living environment and ethnicity. Data was obtained from the Clalit Health Care 
data warehouse, covering over 250,000 children residing in Haifa and Western 
Galilee districts. The population groups were categorized based on ethnicity 
(Jewish vs Arab) and residential settings (urban vs rural). Healthcare 
utilization was consistently higher among Jewish than Arab children, 
irrespective of the specific dimension analyzed. Additionally, urban-dwelling 
children exhibited higher usage rates than those residing in rural areas in all 
investigated dimensions. However, Jewish children showed significantly about 18% 
lower hospitalization rates than Arab children across all years (P < 0.001). No 
significant differences in hospitalizations were observed between urban and 
rural children (RR 0.999, CI (0.987-1.011)). Notably, the study revealed reduced 
antibiotic consumption and hospitalizations over the years for all populations. 
Additionally, we found that Arab children and those living in rural areas had 
reduced access to healthcare, as evidenced by 10-40% fewer physician visits, 
laboratory tests, and imaging (P < 0.001).    Conclusion: This study highlights 
the substantial population-based disparities in healthcare utilization among 
children in Israel despite the equalizing effect of the national health 
insurance law. Rural and low socioeconomic populations seem to have reduced 
healthcare access, showing decreased healthcare utilization. Consequently, it is 
imperative to address these disparities and implement targeted interventions to 
enhance healthcare access for Arab children and rural communities. The decline 
in antibiotic usage and hospitalizations suggests positive trends in pediatric 
health care, necessitating ongoing efforts to ensure equitable access and 
quality of care for all populations. What is Known: • Healthcare systems 
worldwide vary in coverage and accessibility, including Israel, which stands out 
for its diverse population. • Existing research primarily focuses on healthcare 
utilization among adults, leaving a need for comprehensive data on children's 
healthcare patterns globally. What is New: • Investigating over 250,000 
children, this study reveals higher healthcare utilization among Jewish and 
urban children across all dimensions. • Despite Israel's national health 
insurance law, the study underscores the significant population-based 
disparities in healthcare utilization.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifaceted disease that encompasses 
diverse clinical phenotypes. The diversity of PD could be subtyped based on the 
temporal dynamic status of cardiac sympathetic innervation; (1) initially, 
denervated myocardium (peripheral nervous system-predominant; PNS-predominant), 
(2) preserved myocardium (central nervous system-predominant; CNS-predominant), 
and (3) preserved myocardium who developed cardiac sympathetic denervation (CSD) 
on the subsequent imaging (Converter; delayed cardiac denervation). This study 
assessed how the cardiac denervation could reflect the pathobiology. We 
investigated whether this phenotyping could help predict the motor progression 
trajectory of PD.
METHODS: Cardiac sympathetic innervation was evaluated using initial and 
sequential 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy and patients 
were stratified into three groups as above. Motor severity and progression were 
evaluated in each patient. The association between subtypes and dopaminergic 
nigrostriatal degeneration was analyzed. The influence of cardiac denervation on 
motor progression was also investigated.
RESULTS: Among the enrolled 195 patients, 144 PD subjects were defined as 
PNS-predominant, 16 as Converter, and 35 as CNS-predominant. The most severe 
nigrostriatal degeneration was observed in the PNS-predominant group and the 
dopaminergic degeneration was the most asymmetric in the CNS-predominant group. 
Positive linear trends of nigrostriatal degeneration and its asymmetric 
degeneration of striatum and globus pallidus were found across the patterns of 
cardiac sympathetic innervation (PNS-predominant vs. Converter vs. 
CNS-predominant). It indicated an increasing degree of asymmetric degeneration 
among the groups. A longitudinal estimation of motor progression revealed 
distinct cardiac denervation trajectories for each subtype.
CONCLUSIONS: These results implicated that the subtypes of CSD might indicate a 
predominant origin and spreading pattern of pathobiology.

The patient-donor human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match remains the most important 
prognostic factor for successful unrelated donor haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (UD-HSCT). This single-centre study comprised 125 adult patients 
with malignant haematological diseases undergoing their first UD-HSCT. The 
primary goal of this study was to validate the impact of HLA matching on HSCT 
outcomes, specifically at the HLA-DPB1 and HLA-DRB3/4/5 loci. A multivariable 
Cox regression analysis with a backward selection algorithm was employed to 
assess the associations of selected prognostic factors with outcomes after 
UD-HSCT. Any HLA locus mismatch was found to be associated with an increased 
incidence of grade II-IV acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) at 100 days 
(p = .031; hazard ratio [HR] 1.935) and 6 months (p = .004; HR 2.284) after 
HSCT. The results of the following analyses also confirmed the strong impact of 
HLA-DPB1-only mismatch on the incidence of grade II-IV aGvHD at 100-day 
(p = .006; HR 2.642) as well as at 6-month (p = .007; HR 2.401) time periods. 
The HLA-DPB1-only mismatch was also shown to be statistically significantly 
associated with lower relapse incidence (p = .034; HR 0.333). The impact of the 
HLA-DRB3/4/5 mismatch on outcomes was inconclusive, though the two and more 
HLA-DPB1 + DRB3/4/5-only mismatches showed a trend towards worse outcomes than a 
single mismatch. Based on our findings and those of more comprehensive studies, 
the extended HLA loci typing of patients and donors is suggested to avoid 
unexpected HLA mismatches during the UD selection.

INTRODUCTION: We estimated the ages when associations between Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) genes and brain volumes begin among middle-aged and older adults.
METHODS: Among 45,616 dementia-free participants aged 45-80, linear regressions 
tested whether genetic risk score for AD (AD-GRS) had age-dependent associations 
with 38 regional brain magnetic resonance imaging volumes. Models were adjusted 
for sex, assessment center, genetic ancestry, and intracranial volume.
RESULTS: AD-GRS modified the estimated effect of age (per decade) on the 
amygdala (-0.41 mm3 [-0.42, -0.40]); hippocampus (-0.45 mm3 [-0.45, -0.44]), 
nucleus accumbens (-0.55 mm3 [-0.56, -0.54]), thalamus (-0.38 mm3 [-0.39, 
-0.37]), and medial orbitofrontal cortex (-0.23 mm3 [-0.24, -0.22]). Trends 
began by age 45 for the nucleus accumbens and thalamus, 48 for the hippocampus, 
51 for the amygdala, and 53 for the medial orbitofrontal cortex. An AD-GRS 
excluding apolipoprotein E (APOE) was additionally associated with entorhinal 
and middle temporal cortices.
DISCUSSION: APOE and other genes that increase AD risk predict lower hippocampal 
and other brain volumes by middle age.

The coronavirus disease pandemic has presented healthcare systems with 
unprecedented challenges globally and substantially impacted the management of 
chronic diseases such as schizophrenia. This narrative review highlights the 
usefulness of long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) as maintenance 
therapy for patients with schizophrenia during the pandemic. The analysis of 
relevant literature and psychiatric survey data revealed diverse trends in LAIs 
prescription and patient adherence with oral antipsychotics. Although some 
studies have reported a decrease in LAIs prescriptions owing to pandemic-related 
disruptions, others have suggested stable patient adherence with oral 
antipsychotics. Approximately 70% of Japanese psychiatrists reported an increase 
in schizophrenia relapse rates in a survey, underscoring the critical role of 
LAIs in maintaining therapeutic stability. The potential benefits of LAIs with 
extended dosing intervals have been highlighted, including improving oral 
medication adherence and reducing the frequency of hospital visits. In 
conclusion, this review emphasizes the continued need for uninterrupted LAIs 
therapy in conjunction with community and home-based care despite the 
disruptions caused by the coronavirus disease pandemic. Further development of 
LAIs maintenance therapy strategies considering the ongoing pandemic and 
potential future public health emergencies are required.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer patients are commonly treated with sequential 
administrations of epirubicin-cyclophosphamide (EC) and paclitaxel (TAX). The 
chronic effect of this treatment induces skeletal muscle alterations, but the 
specific effect of each chemotherapy agent is unknown. This study aimed to 
investigate the effect of EC or TAX administration on skeletal muscle 
homeostasis in breast cancer patients.
METHODS: Twenty early breast cancer patients undergoing EC followed by TAX 
chemotherapies were included. Two groups of 10 women were established and 
performed vastus lateralis skeletal muscle biopsies either before the first 
administration (pre) of EC (50 ± 14 years) or TAX (50 ± 16 years) and 4 days 
later (post). Mitochondrial respiratory capacity recording, reactive oxygen 
species production, western blotting and histological analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Decrease in muscle fibres cross-sectional area was only observed 
post-EC (-25%; P < 0.001), associated with a reduction in mitochondrial 
respiratory capacity for the complex I (CI)-linked substrate state (-32%; 
P = 0.001), oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by CI (-35%; P = 0.002), CI&CII 
(-26%; P = 0.022) and CII (-24%; P = 0.027). If H2 O2 production was unchanged 
post-EC, an increase was observed post-TAX for OXPHOS by CII (+25%; P = 0.022). 
We found a decrease in makers of mitochondrial content, as shown post-EC by a 
decrease in the protein levels of citrate synthase (-53%; P < 0.001) and VDAC 
(-39%; P < 0.001). Despite no changes in markers of mitochondrial fission, a 
decrease in the expression of a marker of mitochondrial inner-membrane fusion 
was found post-EC (OPA1; -60%; P < 0.001). We explored markers of mitophagy and 
found reductions post-EC in the protein levels of PINK1 (-63%; P < 0.001) and 
Parkin (-56%; P = 0.005), without changes post-TAX. An increasing trend in Bax 
protein level was found post-EC (+96%; P = 0.068) and post-TAX (+77%; 
P = 0.073), while the Bcl-2 level was decreased only post-EC (-52%; P = 0.007). 
If an increasing trend in TUNEL-positive signal was observed post-EC (+68%; 
P = 0.082), upregulation was highlighted post-TAX (+86%; P < 0.001), suggesting 
activation of the apoptosis process.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that a single administration of EC induced, in only 
4 days, skeletal muscle atrophy and mitochondrial alterations in breast cancer 
patients. These alterations were characterized by reductions in mitochondrial 
function and content as well as impairment of mitochondrial dynamics and an 
increase in apoptosis. TAX administration did not worsen these alterations as 
this group had already received EC during the preceding weeks. However, it 
resulted in an increased apoptosis, likely in response to the increased H2 O2 
production.

OBJECTIVES: Improved survival after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and 
an increasingly comorbid transplant population may give rise to new trends in 
the causes of death.
METHODS: This study includes all adult allogeneic HCT recipients transplanted at 
Rigshospitalet between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019. Underlying causes 
of death were determined using the Classification of Death Causes after 
Transplantation (CLASS) method.
RESULTS: Among 802 HCT recipients, 289 died during the study period. The main 
causes of death were relapse (N = 133, 46.0%), graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) 
(N = 64, 22.1%) and infections (N = 35, 12.1%). Multivariable analyses showed 
that with increasing transplant calendar year, a decreased risk of all-cause 
mortality (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87-0.97) and death from GvHD (HR 0.87, 95% CI 
0.78-0.97) was identified, but not for other specific causes. Standardized 
mortality ratios (SMRs) for all-cause mortality decreased from 23.8 (95% CI 
19.1-28.5) to 18.4 (95% CI 15.0-21.9) for patients transplanted in 2010-2014 
versus 2015-2019, while SMR for patients who died from GvHD decreased from 8.19 
(95% CI 5.43-10.94) to 3.65 (95% CI 2.13-5.18).
CONCLUSIONS: As risk of all-cause mortality and death from GvHD decreases, death 
from relapse remains the greatest obstacle in further improvement of survival 
after HCT.

INTRODUCTION: Obesity is an increasing public health concern worldwide and can 
lead to more complications in pregnancy and childbirth. Women with obesity more 
often require induction of labor for various indications. The aim of this study 
is to assess which method of induction of labor is safest and most effective in 
women with obesity.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of two randomized controlled 
trials about induction of labor. Women with a term singleton pregnancy in 
cephalic presentation, an unfavorable cervix, intact membranes and without a 
previous cesarean section were randomly allocated to cervical priming with a 
Foley catheter or vaginal prostaglandin-E2-gel (PROBAAT-I) or a Foley catheter 
or oral misoprostol (PROBAAT-II). The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the 
studies were identical. Induction methods were compared in women with obesity 
(body mass index ≥30.0). Main outcomes were cesarean section and postpartum 
hemorrhage (blood loss >1000 mL).
RESULTS: A total of 2664 women, were included in the trials, 517 of whom were 
obese: 254 women with obesity received a Foley catheter, 176 oral misoprostol 
and 87 prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). A cesarean section was performed in 29.1% of 
women allocated to Foley vs 22.2% in the misoprostol and 23.0% in the PGE2 
groups. Comparisons between groups revealed no statistically significant 
differences: the relative risk [RR] was 1.31 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
0.94-1.84) in the Foley vs misoprostol group and 1.27 (95% CI 0.83-1.95) in the 
Foley vs PGE2 group. The rates of postpartum hemorrhage were comparable (10.6%, 
11.4% and 6.9%, respectively; P = 0.512). In women with obesity, more often a 
switch to another method occurred in the Foley group, (20.1% vs 6.3% in 
misoprostol vs 1.1% in the PGE2 group; P < 0.001). The risk of a failed Foley 
placement was higher in women with obesity than in women without obesity (8.3% 
vs 3.2%; adjusted odds ratio 3.12, 95% CI 1.65-5.90).
CONCLUSIONS: In women with obesity we found a nonsignificant trend towards an 
increased rate of cesarean sections in the group induced with a Foley catheter 
compared to oral misoprostol; however, the study lacked power for this subgroup 
analysis. The finding of a higher risk of failed placement of a Foley catheter 
in women with obesity can be used in shared decision making.

The sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has received increasing attention 
over the past few years. This scientometric study analyzed the SIF research 
field, based on publications available in Web of Science Core Collection 
visualization, and cluster analysis enabled us to map the knowledge domain and 
intellectual landscape of this field and identify thematic trends, landmark 
articles, and emerging research themes. In this study, the software VOSviewer 
and CiteSpace were used to identify the intellectual base and research front 
using visualization and analysis. Then, we analyzed synthesized networks of 
co-authorship (author, institution, and country), co-citation (author, document, 
and journal), and co-occurring keywords. SIF has increased its publication 
output steadily since 2002. This study provided a visual knowledge map of the 
major research domains of SIF. Also, explanations and implications of the 
findings were explored, and the emerging trends were identified. This report 
provides a thorough overview of the current state and growth trends of SIF 
research, and it helps researchers and practitioners understand the major areas 
of attention in this area and provides insights into prospective areas for 
further study.

BACKGROUND: Melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), as a cytoplasmic 
sensor for viral double-stranded RNAs, has received increasing attention in 
recent years. Although considerable headway has been made on the functional role 
of MDA5 in antiviral immunity and autoimmune disease, the available literature 
is insufficient to assess the vast field.
METHODS: This study performed a bibliometric analysis to investigate current 
hotspots in the global scientific output of MDA5 over the past two decades. 
Related publications and recorded information from 2002 to 2022 in the Web of 
Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database were retrieved. VOSviewer and CiteSpace 
were used for quantitative evaluation and visualization.
RESULTS: A total of 2267 original articles and reviews were obtained, and the 
annual number of publications related to MDA5 was increasing rapidly. China has 
published the most papers, while the USA was the most influential country with 
the most citations and the highest H-index. The Chinese Academy of Sciences, the 
United States Department of Health and Human Services, and the Journal of 
Virology were the most prolific research affiliation, funding source, and 
journal, respectively. Fujita T (Kyoto University) was the most productive 
author with the highest H-index and had close cooperation with Kato H and 
Yoneyama M. The keywords "RIG-I," "MDA5," "innate immunity," 
"double-stranded-RNA," and "recognition" had the highest frequency, while 
"dermatomyositis" as well as "autoantibody" seemed to be the emerging hotspots.
CONCLUSION: This study comprehensively demonstrated the research frontiers of 
MDA5 and will provide a useful resource for scholars to conduct future 
decisions.
KEY POINTS: We conducted the first in-depth survey of the research frontiers on 
melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) over the past two decades via 
bibliometric analysis. We found that many early breakthroughs have been made in 
the mechanism of MDA5-mediated antiviral immune responses, and the role of MDA5 
in autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases has raised the recent concern. We 
identified that the virus infection-associated pathogenesis and effective 
therapeutic strategy of anti-MDA5 antibody-positive dermatomyositis will remain 
the hotspots in the future.

Photodissociation of CO2 via the 1Πg state is investigated using a time-sliced 
velocity-mapped ion imaging apparatus combined with a tunable vacuum ultraviolet 
photolysis source. The main O(1D2) + CO(X1Σ+) channel is directly observed from 
the measured images of O(1D2) photoproducts at 129.08-134.76 nm. The total 
kinetic energy release spectra determined based on these images show that the 
energetic thresholds for the O(1D2) + CO(X1Σ+) photoproducts correspond to the 
thermochemical thresholds for the photodissociation of CO2(v2 = 0) and CO2(v2 = 
1). One significant difference among the CO(X1Σ+, v) vibrational distributions 
for the predominant CO2(v2 = 0) dissociation is that the population of CO(v = 0) 
becomes favorable at 130.23-133.45 nm compared to the Boltzmann-like component 
(v > 0) that always exists at 129.08-134.76 nm. The wavelength dependences of 
the overall β are found to follow the variation trend of the CO(v = 0) abnormal 
intensity. The vibrational state-specific β values present a roughly decreasing 
trend with an increase in v, whereas β(v = 0) appears to be significantly larger 
than β(v = 1) at 130.23-133.45 nm compared to 134.76 and 129.08 nm. The 
non-statistical CO(v = 0) with larger β values at 130.23-133.45 nm implies that 
an additional pathway may open through the conical intersection coupling to the 
dissociative 21A'  state, except for the ever-existing pathway that yields the 
Boltzmann-like component. In contrast, at 129.08 nm, the restoration of the 
statistical equilibrium in the CO(X1Σ+, v) vibrational distribution may be 
caused by the emergence of novel dissociation pathways arising from the 
participation of the 31A″ state.

From the beginning of the usage of radiotherapy (RT) for cancer treatment, 
mathematical modeling has been integral to understanding radiobiology and for 
designing treatment approaches and schedules. There has been extensive modeling 
of response to RT with the inclusion of various degrees of biological 
complexity. In this study, we compare three models of tumor volume dynamics: (1) 
exponential growth with RT directly reducing tumor volume, (2) logistic growth 
with direct tumor volume reduction, and (3) logistic growth with RT reducing the 
tumor carrying capacity with the objective of understanding the implications of 
model selection and informing the process of model calibration and 
parameterization. For all three models, we: examined the rates of change in 
tumor volume during and RT treatment course; performed parameter sensitivity and 
identifiability analyses; and investigated the impact of the parameter 
sensitivity on the tumor volume trajectories. In examining the tumor volume 
dynamics trends, we coined a new metric - the point of maximum reduction of 
tumor volume (MRV) - to quantify the magnitude and timing of the expected 
largest impact of RT during a treatment course. We found distinct timing 
differences in MRV, dependent on model selection. The parameter identifiability 
and sensitivity analyses revealed the interdependence of the different model 
parameters and that it is only possible to independently identify tumor growth 
and radiation response parameters if the underlying tumor growth rate is 
sufficiently large. Ultimately, the results of these analyses help us to better 
understand the implications of model selection while simultaneously generating 
falsifiable hypotheses about MRV timing that can be tested on longitudinal 
measurements of tumor volume from pre-clinical or clinical data with high 
acquisition frequency. Although, our study only compares three particular 
models, the results demonstrate that caution is necessary in selecting models of 
response to RT, given the artifacts imposed by each model.
